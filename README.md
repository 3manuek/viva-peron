Don't let the facists control our democracy!

Install this app in your enemy's laptop and cron it to run each time they try to hit
our leader and party.


Sponsored by CFK, Massa, Moyano, D'Elia, Barrionuevo, Clarin (until 2005), Anibal BMW Fernandez among other
erudites of the argentinian democracy.

Duhalde approves this too, but in other branch.

La Campora tried to contribute. However, they inserted too much bugs in the code, so we rejected the patches.

Enjoy with your family and cheer with them as D'Elia when Uriburu died.
